A self-hosted VPN is a simple and secure way to access your home or
small business network. For small businesses, this is a great way to
set up a VPN connection to allow your employees to work remote. For
the rest of us, it is also a great way to secure your Internet
connection when using unsecured WiFi.

And for a self-hosted VPN solution,
[OpenVPN](https://www.openvpn.net/) is one of the best solutions. One
of the best known as well. Itâ€™s free and there are both desktop and
mobile clients available.

Using Docker and docker-compose allows for an easy and clean
installation of OpenVPN, which can be easily upgraded or cleaned-up
without affecting the host system and anything else installed on it.

A self-hosted VPN is a simple and secure way to access your home or
small business network. For small businesses, this is a great way to
set up a VPN connection to allow your employees to work remote. For
the rest of us, it is also a great way to secure your Internet
connection when using unsecured WiFi.

For a self-hosted VPN solution, [OpenVPN](https://www.openvpn.net/) is
one of the best and well known. Itâ€™s free and there are both desktop
and mobile clients available.

With docker-compose you can make an easy and clean installation of
OpenVPN, which can be easily upgraded or cleaned-up without affecting
the host system and anything else installed on it.

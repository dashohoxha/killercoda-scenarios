[MinIO](https://min.io/) is a cloud storage server compatible with
Amazon S3, released under Apache License v2. As an object store, MinIO
can store unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups
and container images. The maximum size of an object is 5TB.

We will see how to install it with
[docker-scripts](https://gitlab.com/docker-scripts/minio#installation)
in a container.

In this lesson we will build a simple ML project from scratch. It
explores the NLP problem of predicting tags for a given StackOverflow
question. For example, we want the model to classify posts about the
Python language by tagging them with `python`.

However the aim is to show how DVC can be used, so ML details will not
be discussed. We will assume that the python scripts process the data
properly and will not explain how it works.

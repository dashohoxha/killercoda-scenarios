# Using tags and branches

In a small git repo it may not be so difficult to go back to a certain
version by counting the commits, or by using commit id-s. But in a
normal git repo this becomes quickly unmanageable. The recommended way
for marking versions of interest is by using tags and branches.

1. Let's mark the versions of `file.txt.dvc` with tags `v1`, `v2`,
   `v3`:
   
   `git checkout master`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc checkout`{{execute}}

   `git tag v3`{{execute}}
   
   `git tag v2 HEAD~1`{{execute}}
   
   `git tag v1 HEAD~2`{{execute}}
   
   `git tag`{{execute}}
   
   `git log --oneline`{{execute}}
   
2. Let's use these tags to get a previous version of `file.txt`:
   
   `git checkout v1`{{execute}}
   
   `git status`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc checkout file.txt.dvc`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `cat file.txt`{{execute}}
   
3. Let's go back to the latest version:
   
   `git status`{{execute}}
   
   `git checkout master`{{execute}}
   
   `git status`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc checkout file.txt.dvc`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `cat file.txt`{{execute}}

4. If you wish, try yourself to go to version `v2` of the file, and
   then back to the latest version.

5. If you run `dvc gc` now, it will leave only one copy of the data
   file on the cache, the one that corresponds with the current data
   file (which has the checksum stored on `file.txt.dvc`). The other
   two will be deleted. If we want to be careful and not delete the
   cached versions related to the tags and branches, we should use the
   options `-a, --all-branches` and `-T, --all-tags`:
   
   `tree -a -I .git`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc gc -a -T`{{execute}}
   
   `tree -a -I .git`{{execute}}
   
   We told `dvc gc` to skip (not delete) any cached files that are
   marked by any tags or branches, so nothing was deleted.
   
   `dvc gc -T`{{execute}}
   
   `tree -a -I .git`{{execute}}
   
   We told `dvc gc` to skip (not delete) any cached files that are
   marked by any tags, so again nothing was deleted.
   
   `dvc gc`{{execute}}
   
   `tree -a -I .git`{{execute}}
   
   This time only one version of the file has remained in the cache,
   the one corresponding to the version that is present in the
   workspace, the others have been deleted.

   If we try now to go back to a previous version of the file, it will
   not be in cache:
   
   `git checkout v2`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc checkout file.txt.dvc`{{execute}}
   
   `dvc status`{{execute}}
   
   `cat file.txt`{{execute}}

In order to share data or models outside of the context of a single
project, for example with other collaborators, or even with yourself,
in a different computing environment, we need to setup a data storage.

Then we can use `dvc push` and `dvc pull`. They provides a basic
collaboration workflow, similar to `git push` and `git pull`.

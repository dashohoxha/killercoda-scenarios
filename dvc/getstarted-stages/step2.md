# Build a stage

The script `src/prepare.py` splits the data into datasets for training
and testing:

```
highlight src/prepare.py \
    -O xterm256 | less -r
```{{execute}}

Let's build a stage based on this script:

```
dvc run \
    -f prepare.dvc \
    -d src/prepare.py \
    -d data/data.xml \
    -o data/prepared \
    python \
        src/prepare.py \
        data/data.xml
```{{execute}}

The output of `dvc run` is telling us that it is running the given
python command. The output of this command is supposed to be on the
directory `data/prepared`, as indicated by the option `-o`
(output). So, after running the command, the output directory is added
to `data/.gitignore` and is saved in `.dvc/cache/`. Finally, the
information needed for rerunning this stage is saved in the file
`prepare.dvc`, which is indicated by the option `-f` (filename). The
options `-d` indicate the dependencies of this stage. We will see
later what are dependencies and how they are used by DVC.

`git status -s`{{execute}}

`git diff data/.gitignore`{{execute}}

`tree -a data/`{{execute}}

Notice that `train.tsv` and `test.tsv` have been created on
`data/prepared/`.

`cat prepare.dvc`{{execute}}

The stage file created by `dvc run` is similar to the data-tracking
file created by `dvc add`, but it also has the field `cmd:` for the
command and the field `deps:` for dependencies.

`tree .dvc/cache/`{{execute}}

Notice how the MD5 hash of `data/prepared` output corresponds to
the path of the cached directory.

`cat .dvc/cache/*/*.dir`{{execute}}

```
cat .dvc/cache/*/*.dir \
    | python -m json.tool \
    | highlight -S json -O xterm256
```{{execute}}

So, the cached directory entry contains a list of the paths and MD5
hashes of the files that are inside the tracked directory, in JSON
format, and these files themselves are also saved in the cache,
named after their MD5 hashes.

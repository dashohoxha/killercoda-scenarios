`pw` is a simple command-line password manager that keeps passwords
inside a gpg encrypted tgz archive. The content of the archive is a
directory tree with a file for each password entry. The first line of
the file is the password, and the rest can optionally be additional or
related info. It provides commands for manipulating the passwords,
allowing the user to add, remove, edit, generate passwords etc.

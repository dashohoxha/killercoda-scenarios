One of the main functions of DVC is tracking data files and
directories and their versions. The data files in DS/ML usually are
binary or big, such that GIT is not suitable for tracking them. Here
is where DVC comes to rescue. In this scenario we will see how to use
DVC to track data and their versions.

DVC and GIT are not exclusive to each-other; DVC is usually integrated
with GIT so that while GIT keeps track of the code and configuration
files, DVC keeps track of the data. However DVC can also work
independently of GIT, and this is how we will use it in this scenario,
in order to keep the complexity low and to focus on the basic features
of DVC. In later scenarios we will also see how DVC works together
with GIT and how it takes advantage of GITs versioning features to
keep track of the data versions.

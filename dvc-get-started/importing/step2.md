# Where is the data file?

Note that the file `get-started/data.xml` is not retrieved from the
Git repository. If you look at the
[dataset-registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry) you
cannot find it anywhere. However it is listed on the file
[get-started/data.xml.dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/get-started/data.xml.dvc).

This makes sense because DVC does not store data files on Git. Instead
they are stored on a data storage (somewhere on cloud).

So, `dvc get` and `dvc import` retrieve a data file from the
**default data storage** of the given Git project, the data storage
that is added with `dvc remote add --default`, and that is stored on
the file `.dvc/config` of the remote project.

If you check
[.dvc/config](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/.dvc/config)
you will see that the url of the default data storage is
https://remote.dvc.org/dataset-registry, and that is where `dvc get`
and `dvc import` retrieve the data file from.

However there is one more catch: the data storage is just a backup for
the DVC cached files, so don't expect to find there the path
`get-started/data.xml`. Instead you may find there a path like
`a3/04afb96060aad90176268345e10355` which is derived from the MD5 hash
of the data file. You can find this hash on
[get-started/data.xml.dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/get-started/data.xml.dvc).

Just for fun, let's try to download it with `wget`:

```
storage=https://remote.dvc.org/dataset-registry
path='a3/04afb96060aad90176268345e10355'
wget -O data.xml.1 $storage/$path
```{{execute}}

`ls -lh`{{execute}}

`diff data.xml data.xml.1`{{execute}}

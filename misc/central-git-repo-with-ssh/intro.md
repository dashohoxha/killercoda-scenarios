To synchronize the work on a programming project we usually use
GitHub, GitLab, etc. It is also possible to install and use one of the
GitHub-like systems in your own server, like:
- https://gitea.io/
- https://about.gitlab.com/install/
- https://gitbucket.github.io/
- https://kallithea-scm.org/
- http://gitprep.yukikimoto.com/
- https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb
- http://gitblit.github.io/gitblit/
- https://gitlist.org/

However if you don't need a web interface, issue management, pull
requests, and other fancy features, you can easily create a central
Git repository on your own server and access it through ssh.  This
tutorial shows how to do it.

## Create a virtual block device

Linux supports a special block device called the loop device, which
maps a normal file onto a virtual block device. This allows for the
file to be used as a "virtual file system".

1. Create a file of size 1G:

   `fallocate -l 1G disk.img`{{execute}}

   `du -hs disk.img`{{execute}}

2. Create a loop device with this file:

   `sudo losetup -f disk.img`{{execute}}

   The option `-f` finds an unused loop device.

3. Find the name of the loop device that was created:

   `losetup -a`{{execute}}
   
   `losetup -a | grep disk.img`{{execute}}

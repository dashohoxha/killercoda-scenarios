## Copy files with '--reflink'

1. Create for testing a file of size 100 MB (with random data):

   `cd mnt/`{{execute}}
   
   `dd if=/dev/urandom of=test bs=1M count=100`{{execute}}

2. Check that now there are **140M** of disk space used:

   `df -h .`{{execute}}

3. Create a copy of the file (with reflinks enabled):

   `cp -v --reflink=always test test1`{{execute}}

4. Check the size of each file:

   `ls -hsl`{{execute}}

    Each of them is **100M** and in total there are **200M** of data.

5. However if we check the disk usage we will see that both of them
   still take on disk the same amout of space as before **140M**:

   `df -h .`{{execute}}

This shows the space-saving feature of reflinks. If the file was big
enough, we would have noticed as well that the reflink copy takes no
time at all, it is done instantly.

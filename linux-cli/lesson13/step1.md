# Looping with `for`

1. With `for` we can loop a list of words:

   `for i in A B C D; do echo $i; done`{{execute}}
   
   `for i in {A..D}; do echo $i; done`{{execute}}
      
   `for i in *.sh; do echo "$i"; done`{{execute}}
   
   In these cases it is using shell expansions.
   
   The last file expansion may fail if there are no files like that,
   in which case shell will return just `*.sh` (instead of a list of
   matching files). To protect against this, we can rewrite the last
   example like this:

   `for i in *.sh; do [[ -e "$i" ]] && echo "$i"; done`{{execute}}
   
2. Let's see an example that finds the longest word in a file:

   `vim longest-word.sh`{{execute}}
   
   Actually it can take one or more files as parameters and process
   each of them. This is implemented by the `while` loop:
   
   ```
   while [[ -n "$1" ]]; do
       if [[ -r "$1" ]]; then
           # . . . . .
	       # . . . . .
	   fi
       shift
   done
   ```

   The `if` checks that the file is readable (otherwise it is
   skipped).

   The list of words of the file is produced by the command `strings
   "$1"`. We use a _command substitution_ to use this list in the for
   statement:
   
   `for i in $(strings "$1"); do`
   
   Notice that we are not surrounding `$(strings "$1")` with double
   quotes, otherwise it will be treated as a single string, which is
   not what we want.
   
   Let's try it:
   
   `echo *`{{execute}}
   
   `./longest-word.sh *`{{execute}}

3. Let's see a slightly modified version of the previous example:

   `vim longest-word2.sh`{{execute}}

   The modification consists on replacing the `while` loop with a
   `for` loop like this:
   
   ```
   for i; do
       if [[ -r "$i" ]]; then
           # . . . . .
	       # . . . . .
	   fi
   done
   ```
   
   And since we are using the variable `i` for the outer loop, in the
   inner loop we have replaced `i` with `j`.
   
   When we omit the list of words, `for` will use by default the
   positional parameters.

   `echo *`{{execute}}

   `./longest-word2.sh *`{{execute}}

4. `for` has also another form, which is similar to that of C (and
   many other languages):
   
   `for ((i=0; i<5; i=i+1)); do echo $i; done`{{execute}}

   As you know, the construct `((...))` is used for arithmetic
   expressions, and inside it we don't use a `$` in front of
   the variables.

5. Let's also make a small modification to the program `sys_info.sh`
   that we saw in the last lesson:
   
   `vim sys_info.sh`{{execute}}
   
   Only the last function (`report_home_space ()`) has been modified.
   It provides more detail for each userâ€™s home directory and includes
   the total number of files and subdirectories in each. We also use
   some local variables and use `printf` (instead of `echo`) to format
   some of the output.
   
   `./sys_info.sh > report.html`{{execute}}
   
   `lynx report.html`{{execute}}
   
   `qy`{{execute}}

Linux relies heavily on text files for data storage, so it makes sense
that there are many tools for manipulating text. Some of these tools
are:

- `cat` -- Concatenate files and print on the standard output
- `sort` -- Sort lines of text files
- `uniq` -- Report or omit repeated lines
- `cut` -- Extract sections from each line of files
- `paste` -- Merge lines of files
- `join` -- Join lines of two files on a common field
- `comm` -- Compare two sorted files line by line
- `diff` -- Compare files line by line
- `patch` -- Apply a diff file to an original
- `tr` -- Translate or delete characters
- `sed` -- Stream editor for filtering and transforming text
- `aspell` -- Interactive spell checker

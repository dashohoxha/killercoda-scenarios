# Group commands. Subshells. Process substitutions.

1. Group commands and subshells.

   Group command: `{ command1; command2; [command3; ...] }`
   
   Subshell: `(command1; command2; [command3;...])`
   
   Because of the way bash implements group commands, the braces must
   be separated from the commands by a space and the last command must
   be terminated with either a semicolon or a newline prior to the
   closing brace.

   Group commands and subshells are both used to manage redirection:
   
   `date > foo.txt`{{execute}}

   ```
   ls -l > output.txt
   echo "Listing of foo.txt" >> output.txt
   cat foo.txt >> output.txt
   ```{{execute}}
   
   `{ ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt; } > output.txt`{{execute}}
   
   `(ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt) > output.txt`{{execute}}
   
   `{ ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt"; cat foo.txt; } | less`{{execute}}

2. Let's see an example that prints a listing of the files in a
   directory, along with the names of the file's owner and group
   owner. At the end of the listing, the script prints a tally of the
   number of files belonging to each owner and group.

   `./array-2.sh /usr/bin`{{execute}}
   
   `vim array-2.sh`{{execute}}
   
3. A group command (`{ . . . }`) executes all of its commands in the
   current shell.
   
   A subshell (`( . . . )`), as the name suggests, executes its
   commands in a child copy of the current shell. This means the
   environment is copied and given to a new instance of the
   shell. When the subshell exits, the copy of the environment is
   lost, so any changes made to the subshellâ€™s environment (including
   variable assignment) are lost as well. Therefore, in most cases,
   unless a script requires a subshell, group commands are preferable
   to subshells. Group commands are both faster and require less
   memory.
   
   We have seen before that using `read` with pipe does not work as we
   might expect:
   
   `echo "foo" | read`{{execute}}
   
   `echo $REPLY`{{execute}}
   
   This is because the shell executes the command after the pipe
   (`read` in this case) in a subshell. The command `read` assigns a
   value to the variable `REPLAY` in the environment of the subshell,
   but once the command is done executing, the subshell and its
   environment are destroyed. So, the variable `REPLAY` of the current
   shell still is unassigned (does not have a value).

4. To work around this problem, shell provides a special form of
   expansion, called _process substitution_.

   For processes that produce standard output it looks like this:
   `<(list-of-commands)`

   For processes that intake standard input it looks like this:
   `>(list-of-commands)`

   To solve our problem with read, we can employ process substitution
   like this:
   
   `read < <(echo "foo")`{{execute}}
   
   `echo $REPLY`{{execute}}
   
   What is happening is that _process substitution_ allows us to treat
   the output of a subshell as an ordinary file for purposes of
   redirection.

   `echo <(echo "foo")`{{execute}}
   
   By using `echo` we see that the output of the subshell is being
   provided by a file named `/dev/fd/63`.

5. Let's see an example of a `read` loop that processes the contents
   of a directory listing created by a subshell:

   `vim pro-sub.sh`{{execute}}
   
   Because we are using `read`, we cannot use a pipe to send data to
   it.
   
   `./pro-sub.sh`{{execute}}
   
   `./pro-sub.sh /usr/bin | less`{{execute}}

Linux, like UNIX, is not only a multi-tasking, but also a multi-user
system. This means that the system can be used by more than one
user. So, the system needs to identify users and protect them from
each-other.

- Permissions (id, chmod, umask, su, sudo, chown, chgrp, passwd).
- Processes (ps, top, jobs, bg, fg, kill, killall, shutdown).
- Environment.

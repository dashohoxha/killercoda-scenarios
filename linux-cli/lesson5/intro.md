- Each time we type a command and press the Enter key, `bash` does
  some kind of processing upon the text before executing our
  command. For example if there is a "`*`" in the command, it is
  replaced by the names of the matching files. This replacement is
  called an **expansion**.

- Quoting is used to control how the shell splits the input into
  parts.  It also disables some types of expansion. Both single and
  double quotes can be used, and there are some differences between
  them.

- The shell environment (printenv, set, export). Customizing the
  prompt.

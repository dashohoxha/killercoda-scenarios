In this lesson we will get started with some simple commands and their
options, will learn how to navigate and explore the system, etc.:

- What is the shell? Trying some simple commands (`date`, `cal`, `df`,
  `free`, `exit`).
- Navigation (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`). Relative and absolute filenames.
- Exploring the system (`ls`, `file`, `less`). Long directory
  listing. Directory structure on Linux systems.

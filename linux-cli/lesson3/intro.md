Linux, like UNIX, is a multi-tasking and a multi-user system. This
means that the system can run multiple programs at the same time, and
it can be used by more than one user at the same time. One of the
challenges of such a system is that it needs to identify users and
protect them from each-other.

- Users and groups, permissions (useradd, passwd, id, chmod, umask,
  su, sudo, chown, chgrp).
- Processes and signals (ps, pstree, top, jobs, bg, fg, kill, killall,
  shutdown).
- The shell environment (printenv, set, export). Customizing the
  prompt.

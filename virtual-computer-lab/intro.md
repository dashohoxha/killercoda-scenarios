[Virtual Computer Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0r_RTMjePI) is
a desktop server in the cloud that can be accessed from a browser.  It
provides remote collaboration for the students of a class and their
teacher.

Each user can share his desktop with one or more other users and they
can work on it collaboratively. The teacher can also use
[Epoptes](https://epoptes.org/) to watch what each of the students is
doing, to broadcast his screen to all of them, to access the desktop
of each of the students for helping them, etc.

We will see how to install a Virtual Computer Lab with
[docker-scripts](https://gitlab.com/docker-scripts/ds). It is made of
a [LinuxMint container](https://gitlab.com/docker-scripts/linuxmint),
which can be accessed from a browser with the help of a [Guacamole
container](https://gitlab.com/docker-scripts/guacamole).
